A Brief of the Prototype:
            A full fleged banking website that handles net banking and crypto transactions securely by using Hmacsha-512 algorithm.Crypto transactions are handled by blockchain-mechanism.It uses HTML,css and javascript as front-end technology and Java-servlets ,JSP(Java Server Pages) as back-end technology and mysql as database.JDBC is used to connect the backend with the database.This website is used by two type of customers namely normal customer having an account in a bank and a person who has bitcoin wallet.A normal person can first register in the website using the account number given in the bank along with his personal information.Once registered he can login using the account number and password to redirect to his home page.Once logged in he can transfer his money to anather account using net-banking.Here the account can both within the bank or outside the bank.The customer can also get his e-statement of his account.He can also file a complaint to the bank regarding transactions and others.Finally he can also check his bank balance.Now coming to next set of customer Those who have crypto wallets.They first create a account in the website and can transfer the bitcoin to anather peroson using his own bitcoin address. He can also get the current bitcoin price in the market.Finally the person can also act as a miner to mine the transaction on a specific block in the blockchain.
Cool,the passwords of the customer are secured since they are hashed using Hmacsha-512 algoritm before storing it into the database.Salts are also used along with the hash password to increase the security.

NOTE: This project I did it in 3rd year of my study.It contains the authentication and authorization mechanism that is described in the project.
1. Passwords are stored as hash in the database.
2. If a customer forgets his password, he can update his password by entering a OTP that is sent to their mail address.
